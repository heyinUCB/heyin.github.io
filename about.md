## About Me

I am coadvised by Professor Andrew Packard and Professor Murat Arcak.
My main research interests lie in Robust Control, Nonlinear Control and Model Predictive Control(MPC), Machine Learning, and their application to autonomous driving.
Here is the link of my [Lab](https://bcci.me.berkeley.edu). There are many bright guys working there.
