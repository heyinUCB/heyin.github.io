### Robustness analysis of dynamical systems with Neural Network Controllers

[Stability Analysis using Quadratic Constraints for Systems with Neural Network Controllers](https://github.com/heyinUCB/Stability-Analysis-using-Quadratic-Constraints-for-Systems-with-Neural-Network-Controllers)

[IQCbased_ImitationLearning](https://github.com/heyinUCB/IQCbased_ImitationLearning)

Integral quadratic constraints -IQC-, a mathematical tool from the field of Robust Control, are used to
characterize the properties of activation functions in the NNs. A framework that merges IQCs and Lyapunov theory is proposed to analyze the robust performance of systems with NN controllers.

### Safe learning of Regions of Attraction for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems

A framework that merges Gaussian process -GP- and sum-of-squares programming is proposed to compute the regions of attraction for uncertain systems. GP with polynomial kernels is utilized to model the uncertainties in
the systems. A safe exploration controller is designed to safely gather data points for the GP model.

### Safe-by-Design Approach to Path Planning-Tracking for Robotics Systems

* Developed a framework to achieve the most permissive planner while guaranteeing safety of the system.
* Parametrized the constraint sets used for MPC planner and derived the corresponding parametrized tracking
  control law and error bounds. Chose the best parameter to allow for the largest constraint sets.

### Reachability Analysis and Control Synthesis for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems
[Backward Reachability Analysis and Control Synthesis](https://github.com/heyinUCB/Backward-Reachability-Analysis-and-Control-Synthesis)

* Developed a method of computing forward/backward reachable sets for uncertain nonlinear systems.
* Proposed a method of synthesizing controllers for a system to reach the target set while avoiding obstacles.
* The reachable set and controller are computed simultaneously using sum-of-squares - SOS - programming.
