## About Me

I am coadvised by Professor Andrew Packard and Professor Murat Arcak.
My main research interests lie in Robust Control, Nonlinear Control and Model Predictive Control(MPC), Machine Learning, and their application to autonomous driving.
Here is the link of my [Lab](https://bcci.me.berkeley.edu). There are many bright guys working there.

## Experience

TuSimple, Inc San Diego, CA Research Engineer Intern    June 2020 - Aug. 2020
*  Performed system identification using data-driven method to obtain the lateral dynamics of the truck.
*  Designed robust controller and linear parameter varying controller based on the obtained dynamics for the
autonomous-driving truck to track reference trajectories on highways, and local roads, respectively.
*  Design robust motion planner for autonomous-driving trucks by considering tracking error bounds.

TuSimple, Inc San Diego, CA Vehicle Control Intern May    2017 - Aug. 2017
* Designed and implemented Model Predictive Control based Adaptive Cruise Control algorithm to provide
speed profile and waypoint reference for the low-level controller to track.
* Designed the low-level controller using MPC and implemented it in ROS using Python and Julia.
* Tested the autonomous vehicle on various kinds of road conditions, including local roads, highways.
